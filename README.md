```bash
npm i # to get set up
```

```bash
yarn test # or just: jest
yarn build
yarn start # for testing locally on localhost:8000
yarn stop
```

```bash
lhci autorun
```

You can automatically rebuild and restart (instead of typing `yarn run start`) every time you edit a file:

```bash
yarn run continuous-restart # see package.json for details
```

(Don't have `yarn`? [Install `yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) and try again. Try replacing `yarn` with `npm` in the commands above.)
